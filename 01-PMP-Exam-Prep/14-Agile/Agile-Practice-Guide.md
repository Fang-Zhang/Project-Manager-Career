# Agile Practice Guide

## 1. Introduction to Agile
### 1.1. Definable Work vs. High Uncertainty Work
- **Definable Work** is work that is well understood and can be defined in advance.
- **High Uncertainty Work** is work that is not well understood and cannot be defined in advance.
- **Agile** is a set of values and principles that can be used to guide decisions about how to manage work that is high uncertainty.
### 1.2. Agile Manifesto and Mindset
- **Agile Manifesto** is a statement of values that reflects the core ideas of the Agile movement.
- **Agile Mindset** is a set of attitudes consistent with the Agile Manifesto.
### 1.3. Lean and Kanban Method
- **Lean** is a set of principles and practices that can be used to guide decisions about how to manage work.
- **Kanban** is a method for managing knowledge work with an emphasis on just-in-time delivery while not overloading the team members.
### 1.4. Uncertainty, Risk, and Lifecycle Selection
- **Uncertainty** is a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe existing state or future outcome.
- **Risk** is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.
- **Life Cycle Selection** is the process of evaluating different project life cycles (e.g., predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid) and selecting the most appropriate one for the project.
