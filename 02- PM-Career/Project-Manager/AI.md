## Knowledge Areas (Auto Generating the documents is just the first step)
### Integration Management(Break through the imagination)
- When the xxx task could be completed?
- How the resources availability looking like today?
- Historical weather data could be used to predict delays on a construction project.
- Better predictions of resource usage and quality metrics for a project based on a new domain or technology.
- Imagine a scenario when Cognitive intelligent systems are able to interface with external world
  - An iot sensor device on a lab sensor identifies a Temperature /Pressure variance and send an automatic alert to PM in his mobile device
  - Instantly the PM Assistant Bot create an issue entry in Project management system
  - Project manager will assign the task to a team member to investigate
  - Team member investigates and records corrective and preventive measure for the issue in the Project management system
  - Later, when the project manager is planning their next project, a machine learning algorithm alerts them to where a similar issue is likely to arise in the new project, enabling the project manager to proactively address the issue.
- Another example can be usage of AI in Operational Process harmonization in multiple geographies for a multinational company. Regional process owner can document the current process in their country using Business process modelling notation(BPMN) in a BPM platform. Expert systems can analyze the Process across mutliple geographies and suggest and optimized process which can be used across the organization.

### Scope Management(base for Schedule/Resource Areas)
- Creating WBS through Mindmap by machine learning algorithm.
- Expert systems can use organization knowledge base to suggest project schedule and Key performance indicators(KPIs) based on historical data.

### Schedule Management
- cheduling Bot could harness the learning from previous projects and suggest number of possible schedules based on the project context.
- Artificial Neural network can sequence the project activities based on functional requirements.
- Intelligent schedulers can readjust the project schedule based on the project progress and team performance level.
- The AI assistant can plan and forecast the required resources based on an estimation model that it maintains with data from the project itself and other projects.
- The AI assistant can determine if the project is on track and if there are tasks at risk that are on the critical path. 

### Cost Management
- Product development cost can be estimated using statistical methods like component regression and neural network algorithms.
- Machine learning systems are deployed to forecast project cost using the historical data.

### Quality Management
- Project managers can utilize cognitive technologies to gauge the project quality and get insights at next level. Cognitive technologies can be deployed to review key project documents like contracts. 
- With usage of natural language processing capabilities project manager’s AI assistant can scan through complex contracts and understand the key terms, dependencies and commitments. Project managers can spend their valuable time to focus on enhancing quality and exercise their professional judgment rather than spending their energy in reading through tons of documentation.
- Machine learning could be used to recognize, extract and ensure availability of expected documentation and Natural Language processing will enable do understand the exceptions and anomalies. Project management will be provided advanced statistical analysis on the quality of documentation and recommended actions by intelligent Project dashboards.

### Resource Management
- Resourcing bot can match the Skills required for the project with the resource availability in the organization and recommend the resources.
- It can identify the training required based on the resource skill matrix and assign the necessary training.
- In case there is a hiring requirement for project, resource bot can scan data sources like LinkedIn and identify suitable and available candidates. It then automatically reaches out to these candidates with offers.
- It can interface with planning bot and assign tasks to Freelance candidates.
- Once the work is completed and validated the bot the bot coordinates with your accounts payable system to pay the freelancer. The planning bot automatically updates the plan and pushes the data to the BI dashboards.

### Risk Management
- Artificial intelligence supports quantitative risk management by understanding the risk thresholds in a particular project context.
- Machine learning combined with Monte Carlo simulation can support project manager in risk evaluation and simulation.
- Fuzzy logic is used to assess risks in infrastructure projects to model probability distributions.
- Intelligent systems can alert project manager on upstream opportunities (Positive risk) and Downstream obstacles (negative risk) by real time analysis of project data.

### Commmunication Management
- Cognitive systems helps in automating the generation of periodic status reports to stakeholders. Project manager would be able to plan more effort for Personalized communication with stakeholders.
- Project manager can also harness machine learning to analyse social networks like twitter feeds ,facebook comments ,web reviews to understand the enduser feedback ,concerns ,perceptions for a product which is rolled out to a mass market. These insights enable the project manager to prioritize the requirements from the product backlog.
- Streamlining communication between colleagues—even when they don’t speak the same language.

### Procurement Management
- AI will able to provide a risk analysis and credit check of Suppliers and recommend the right supplier to Project manager.
- The next generation of spend analytics will also see computers programmed to cross- check each invoice as they are being entered and spot any inconsistency or error.
- AI-powered Procurement Bot will be able to speak with buyers and suppliers about orders in a conversational interface. 

### Stakeholder Management
- AI Assistant will be able to utilize Sentimental analysis algorithms to mine through the Key communication emails from Customers and understand Customer Satisfaction at any point of time. 
- Project management assistant will also be able to understand Stakeholder analysis based on text analysis and provide recommendations on how to engage with them. 
- When a majority of the routine tasks have been delegated to the AI assistant, the project manager can apply his creative and Professional skills in managing the Stakeholder expectations.

## PMI's Talent Triangle
### Technical Project Management
- Artificial intelligent with Project management assistants, bots and machine learning can play role in providing data driven insights and recommendation to manage the activities. Project manager’s effort towards operational activities would be significantly reduced.

### Strategic and Business Management
- AI based system will help project manager to model the dependent parameters and predict outcomes of the project.

### Leadership
- Aligning all stakeholders to a shared goal is the key to Project success.
