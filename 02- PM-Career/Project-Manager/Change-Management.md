# ADKAR Model

The ADKAR model is a change management framework designed to focus on the individual aspects of change. It was developed by Prosci, a leading change management research and training organization. The ADKAR model is particularly useful for understanding how individuals experience and adapt to change within an organization. The acronym "ADKAR" represents the five key building blocks necessary for successful change at the individual level:

## Awareness:

In this stage, individuals become aware of the need for change. They recognize that something in their current environment or processes must change. It's essential to create awareness by communicating the reasons for change, the expected benefits, and the consequences of not changing.

## Desire:

After becoming aware of the need for change, individuals must develop a desire or willingness to participate in and support the change. In this stage, it's crucial to address personal motivations and concerns, as well as provide a clear vision of how the change will benefit individuals and the organization.

## Knowledge:

To effectively engage in change, individuals require the knowledge and information necessary to understand how to change. They need to know what the change involves, what their role is in the change process, and what is expected of them. Training, communication, and education are critical in this phase.

## Ability:

Once individuals have the knowledge, they must have the ability to implement the change. This involves providing the necessary tools, resources, and support to enable individuals to apply what they have learned. It also includes providing opportunities for practice and skill development.

## Reinforcement:

The final stage is about sustaining the change over the long term. Reinforcement mechanisms, such as incentives, recognition, and feedback, are used to ensure that individuals continue to adopt and support the change. This phase is essential for preventing a return to the previous state.

## Key points to keep in mind about the ADKAR model:

- The  ADKAR model is a sequential model, meaning that individuals typically progress through these stages in a linear order.
- It emphasizes that individuals must move through all five stages for change to be fully effective.
- Not all individuals progress through these stages at the same pace, and some may experience resistance or hesitation at various stages.

The ADKAR model is a valuable tool for change management because it helps change leaders and managers understand the individual experience of change. By addressing the specific needs and concerns of employees at each stage, organizations can better support their staff through the change process and increase the likelihood of successful change adoption. It complements other change management frameworks that focus on the organizational and process aspects of change.
